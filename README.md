# IBMWP

This is a **personal project** I'm currently working on. On this project I'm trying to integrate **Python** with **React** and **CSS**.

The **BMWP**, or Biological Monitoring Working Party, is a procedure that measures **water quality** using the **macroinvertebrate families** as biological indicators. The **IBMWP** is a variant of the BMWP for the **Iberian Peninsula**.

The **first feature** I'm working on is a **dichotomous key** to identify the different macroinvertebrate families. I am creating a **python server**  for this purpose.

The server only works in localhost:4443 for the time being, you need to start it at /server => python3 server.py
