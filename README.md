# IMBWP

This is a personal project I'm currently working on. On this project I'm trying to integrate Python with React.

The BMWP, or Biological Monitoring Working Party, is a procedure that measures water quality using the macroinvertebrate families found on it as biological indicators. The IBMWP is a variant of the BMWP for the Iberian peninsula.

The first feature I'm working on is a key to identify the different macroinvertebrate families.
